## Overview

"py_tk_notifications" is a simple notification system implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. This project provides a user-friendly way to display notifications in a graphical interface, making it suitable for various applications where visual alerts are required.

## Features

- Notification Display & Customization : Shows notifications in a pop-up window with customizable title, message, background color, foreground color, and font.

- Positioning: Notifications are positioned at the bottom right corner of the screen by default, ensuring they are unobtrusive yet noticeable.

- Notification Queue: Supports a queue of notifications, preventing overlap and ensuring a smooth display of multiple notifications.

- Fading Effect: Notifications are displayed with a fading effect, which is, I think, a cool transition.
